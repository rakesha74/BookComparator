This mythological novel is fast-paced, and focuses on duty, love, principles and more. Summary Of The Book The land of Meluha is an empire created by Lord Rama, and it is ruled by the Suryavanshis. This empire is powerful and proud, however, the Saraswati river that is their source of water is slowing drying up. On top of that, the empire is at war with the Chandravanshis who have allied with The Nagas, a group of sinister and deformed human beings who have extraordinary martial art skills. The Immortals Of Meluha, published in 2010, is the first story of the trilogy. Daksha, the king of the Suryavanshis, realizes that his empire needs help. He invites a tribe from Tibet to help him fight off the enemies. The Tibetan Guna tribe is lead by Shiva, who is a fearless soldier, and the only one who does not fall ill on arriving at Meluha. To everyone's surprise, Shiva’s throat turns blue. The locals believe that this warrior is their fabled saviour Lord Shiva, also known as Neelkanth. Shiva goes to Devagiri to meet Daksha and his daughter Princess Sati. There, he learns about the dangerous wars and terror attacks that the Chandravanshis have carried out on the Meluhans. The brave warrior gets enraged, and declares a full war on the enemy. Readers will find this mythological fantasy to be gripping and exciting. Questions about Shiva’s duty, destiny, and karma arise throughout the book.

title:The Oath of the Vayuputras: Shiva Trilogy 3 (English)
productDescription:India’s own super hero is finally here. Shiva has risen yet again to destroy the evildoers. The last of the Shiva Trilogy, this book promises to keep the readers gripped while the great warrior discovers who his true enemies are and gives it his all to destroy them. Summary of the Book The Oath of the Vayuputras is the final book of the Shiva Trilogy. In the earlier books of the trilogy, Shiva finds out that the Nagas are not his enemies and joins hands with them to reach the root of all evil. This book will have answers to ‘the Neelkanth’s’ questions about his fate, the choices he made previously and karma. Further, in the concluding book of the trilogy, Shiva reaches Panchavati, the capital of Naga where he will come face to face with his greatest enemy. Will he win the battle over his wicked enemies, who are out to destroy him and his legacy? The Oath of the Vayuputras will also reveal the reason of Shiva’s close friend Brahaspati’s disappearance and reappearance at the end of the second book, The Secret of the Nagas. Further the relationship between Daksha, the king of Meluha and the mysterious temple priests will also be exposed in this last part of the trilogy. Shiva seeks helps from the Vayuputras in the quest to conquer all evil. The great warrior will encounter the real intentions of some characters he deemed to be close to him. Some new characters will add that extra vitality to the entire plot, especially Shiva’s greatest enemy whose name sends shivers down the spines of many great warriors. An interesting journey of a warrior who is turned into a God by his followers because of his deeds and war against the evil, this book is sure to have its readers’ full attention. A good read which will make one reflect on their actions, this book like the two earlier books of the trilogy focuses on philosophy, religion and the never ending battle between the good and the evil.

productDescription:Today, He is a God. 4000 years ago, He was just a man. The hunt is on. The sinister Naga warrior has killed his friend Brahaspati and now stalks his wife Sati. Shiva, the Tibetan immigrant who is the prophesied destroyer of evil, will not rest till he finds his demonic adversary. His vengeance and the path to evil will lead him to the door of the Nagas, the serpent people. Of that he is certain. The evidence of the malevolent rise of evil is everywhere. A kingdom is dying as it is held to ransom for a miracle drug. A crown prince is murdered. The Vasudevs – Shiva’s philosopher guides – betray his unquestioning faith as they take the aid of the dark side. Even the perfect empire, Meluha is riddled with a terrible secret in Maika, the city of births. Unknown to Shiva, a master puppeteer is playing a grand game. In a journey that will take him across the length and breadth of ancient India, Shiva searches for the truth in a land of deadly mysteries – only to find that nothing is what it seems. Fierce battles will be fought. Surprising alliances will be forged. Unbelievable secrets will be revealed in this second book of the Shiva Trilogy, the sequel to the #1 national bestseller, The Immortals of Meluha.

title:The Immortals of Meluha (English)
productDescription:The story of a man whose fate led him to be considered a God. The mythical story of Shiva is brought into a new perspective in The Immortals of Meluha, the first in a fantasy trilogy. Summary of the Book When Meluha, an empire created centuries earlier by Lord Ram, is under threat from the Chandravanshis and the Nagas, her king, Daksha, sends emissaries to Tibet and asks the tribe there to help him. Among these tribes are the Gunas, and their chief Shiva is a mighty warrior. He moves to Srinagar and in a curious coincidence that sees him alone of all his tribe unaffected by a high fever, Shiva’s throat turns blue and the Meluhans announce him as Neelakanth, their fabled mythic savior. The book begins the story of his life, and how he comes to accept the title given to him, that of the God of Gods. About Amish Tripathi Amish Tripathi is a former Indian banker turned writer. The Secret of the Nagas and The Oath of the Vayuputras complete his Shiva Trilogy, which has since become a bestselling collection. An alumnus of St. Xavier’s College, Mumbai and the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta, he currently lives in Mumbai with his wife and son.

Summary of the Book When Meluha, an empire created centuries earlier by Lord Ram, is under threat from the Chandravanshis and the Nagas, her king, Daksha, sends emissaries to Tibet and asks the tribe there to help him. Among these tribes are the Gunas, and their chief Shiva is a mighty warrior. He moves to Srinagar and in a curious coincidence that sees him alone of all his tribe unaffected by a high fever, Shiva’s throat turns blue and the Meluhans announce him as Neelakanth, their fabled mythic savior. The book begins the story of his life, and how he comes to accept the title given to him, that of the God of Gods. About Amish Tripathi Amish Tripathi is a former Indian banker turned writer. The Secret of the Nagas and The Oath of the Vayuputras complete his Shiva Trilogy, which has since become a bestselling collection.

title:The Oath of the Vayuputras: Shiva Trilogy 3 (English)
productDescription:India’s own super hero is finally here. Shiva has risen yet again to destroy the evildoers. The last of the Shiva Trilogy, this book promises to keep the readers gripped while the great warrior discovers who his true enemies are and gives it his all to destroy them. Summary of the Book The Oath of the Vayuputras is the final book of the Shiva Trilogy. In the earlier books of the trilogy, Shiva finds out that the Nagas are not his enemies and joins hands with them to reach the root of all evil. This book will have answers to ‘the Neelkanth’s’ questions about his fate, the choices he made previously and karma. Further, in the concluding book of the trilogy, Shiva reaches Panchavati, the capital of Naga where he will come face to face with his greatest enemy. Will he win the battle over his wicked enemies, who are out to destroy him and his legacy? The Oath of the Vayuputras will also reveal the reason of Shiva’s close friend Brahaspati’s disappearance and reappearance at the end of the second book, The Secret of the Nagas. Further the relationship between Daksha, the king of Meluha and the mysterious temple priests will also be exposed in this last part of the trilogy. Shiva seeks helps from the Vayuputras in the quest to conquer all evil. The great warrior will encounter the real intentions of some characters he deemed to be close to him. Some new characters will add that extra vitality to the entire plot, especially Shiva’s greatest enemy whose name sends shivers down the spines of many great warriors. An interesting journey of a warrior who is turned into a God by his followers because of his deeds and war against the evil, this book is sure to have its readers’ full attention.

productDescription:Today, He is a God. 4000 years ago, He was just a man. The hunt is on. The sinister Naga warrior has killed his friend Brahaspati and now stalks his wife Sati. Shiva, the Tibetan immigrant who is the prophesied destroyer of evil, will not rest till he finds his demonic adversary. His vengeance and the path to evil will lead him to the door of the Nagas, the serpent people. Of that he is certain. The evidence of the malevolent rise of evil is everywhere. A kingdom is dying as it is held to ransom for a miracle drug. A crown prince is murdered. The Vasudevs – Shiva’s philosopher guides – betray his unquestioning faith as they take the aid of the dark side. Even the perfect empire, Meluha is riddled with a terrible secret in Maika, the city of births. Unknown to Shiva, a master puppeteer is playing a grand game. In a journey that will take him across the length and breadth of ancient India, Shiva searches for the truth in a land of deadly mysteries – only to find that nothing is what it seems. Fierce battles will be fought. Surprising alliances will be forged.

Will he win the battle over his wicked enemies, who are out to destroy him and his legacy? The Oath of the Vayuputras will also reveal the reason of Shiva’s close friend Brahaspati’s disappearance and reappearance at the end of the second book, The Secret of the Nagas. Further the relationship between Daksha, the king of Meluha and the mysterious temple priests will also be exposed in this last part of the trilogy. Shiva seeks helps from the Vayuputras in the quest to conquer all evil. The great warrior will encounter the real intentions of some characters he deemed to be close to him. Some new characters will add that extra vitality to the entire plot, especially Shiva’s greatest enemy whose name sends shivers down the spines of many great warriors. An interesting journey of a warrior who is turned into a God by his followers because of his deeds and war against the evil, this book is sure to have its readers’ full attention.

productDescription:India’s own super hero is finally here. Shiva has risen yet again to destroy the evildoers. The last of the Shiva Trilogy, this book promises to keep the readers gripped while the great warrior discovers who his true enemies are and gives it his all to destroy them. Summary of the Book The Oath of the Vayuputras is the final book of the Shiva Trilogy. In the earlier books of the trilogy, Shiva finds out that the Nagas are not his enemies and joins hands with them to reach the root of all evil. This book will have answers to ‘the Neelkanth’s’ questions about his fate, the choices he made previously and karma. Further, in the concluding book of the trilogy, Shiva reaches Panchavati, the capital of Naga where he will come face to face with his greatest enemy. Will he win the battle over his wicked enemies, who are out to destroy him and his legacy? The Oath of the Vayuputras will also reveal the reason of Shiva’s close friend Brahaspati’s disappearance and reappearance at the end of the second book, The Secret of the Nagas. Further the relationship between Daksha, the king of Meluha and the mysterious temple priests will also be exposed in this last part of the trilogy. Shiva seeks helps from the Vayuputras in the quest to conquer all evil. The great warrior will encounter the real intentions of some characters he deemed to be close to him. Some new characters will add that extra vitality to the entire plot, especially Shiva’s greatest enemy whose name sends shivers down the spines of many great warriors. An interesting journey of a warrior who is turned into a God by his followers because of his deeds and war against the evil, this book is sure to have its readers’ full attention.
